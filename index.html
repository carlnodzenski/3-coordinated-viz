			<textBox>Green land covers (e.g., forests and parks) are associated with better human health. Better health, in turn, may
lead to lower spending on healthcare, an increasingly large portion of the budget of both American citizens and
the government. There is a significant gap in our knowledge on the direct association between green covers and
health care costs. We estimated associations between the percentage of green land cover in a county and its ageand
risk-adjusted Medicare fee-for-service expenditures for each of five types of green land cover (forest, shrub,
grass, agriculture, and urban vegetation) drawn from the 2011 National Land Cover Database. Generalized linear
mixed models were used to predict median regionally standardized per-capita Medicare expenditures for
2010â€“2014 for 3,086 counties (comprising over 30 million Medicare fee-for-service users), with state as a
random effect and controls for environmental, behavioral, and healthcare access covariates. We found associations
between two types of green land cover and healthcare spending. Forest and shrub covers were significantly
and inversely associated with median Medicare fee-for-service spending with small effect sizes. Grass
land cover did not have a statistically significant association with expenditures. For agriculture and urban vegetation
land covers, the results were unclear. Counties with more forest and shrub land cover may hold both
health and economic benefits for the elderly and disabled. This study demonstrates that exposure to green land
cover may be linked to lower healthcare spending. However, more definitive studies, particularly those that use
individual-level data, are needed.<br><br> Published in Urban Forestry & Urban Greening 41 (2019) 39-47<br>
